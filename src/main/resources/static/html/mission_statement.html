            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <h3>In times of crisis, how do we heal?</h3>
            <p>As COVID-19 rages on and society grinds to an unsettling halt, it seems that the entire world has set out to answer this essential question. We, a group of East Bay high school students, believe we have an answer, and we created this website to articulate it.</p>

        <section id="mission-statement-middle" class="mission-statement-text">
            <p>Art is a universal invention. Throughout history, we as a species have often taken advantage of its capacity to connect, inspire, and express. It’s a glue that binds our experiences together.</p>

            <p>We intend to celebrate this cornerstone of our humanity at a time when humanity is being challenged. The Foothill High School Graphic Design Club is proud to host this project as a testament to how our creativity can bring joy and hope no matter what our situation may be.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Patients inflicted with COVID-19 may be confined to beds for weeks depending on their condition, and much of the elderly, who are at most risk, are being forced to stay at home with no visitors. Nurses, doctors, emergency personnel, and sanitation staff are taking extraordinary measures to defend the world against the worst public health threat of the 21st century, and for everyone else, isolation can be emotionally and psychologically distressing. Let’s make comforting well-wishing cards for all of these people to bring some light into our now darkened lives. It can be a picture of the simplest degree, a mere statement, or even a written letter - it’s all up to you.</p>

            <p>Thanks,</p>
